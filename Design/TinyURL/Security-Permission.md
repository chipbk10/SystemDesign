- Can users create private URLs or allow a particular set of users to access a URL?
- We can store persmision level (public/private) with each URL in the database.
- We can also create a separate table to store UserIDs that have permission to see a specific URL
- If the user doesn't have permission and tries to access a URL, we can send an error (HTTP 401) back.
- @Todo: SQL or No-SQL in this case?
