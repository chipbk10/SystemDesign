I.**Question**
- Design a scalable URL shortening service like Bitly. The system should allow users to submit a long URL and receive a shortened version, which can then be used to redirect to the original URL. It should handle a large volume of requests efficiently and be reliable.
- It should provide some basic analytics, like the number of times a short URL has been clicked.
- Change the design if needed to track some more advanced analytics like country of the visitor, date and time of access, browser or platform where the page was accessed
- Can users create private URLs or allow (or share with) a particular set of users to access a URL?
