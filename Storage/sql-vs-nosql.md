I.**SQL wins**:
- **[ACID]() compliance**: critical for apps like banking where data integrity (tính toàn vẹn dữ liệu) matters above all
- **Complex queries**: SQL is powerful with join operations on relational structured data and support a mature query language

II.**NoSQL wins**:
- **Scalability**: SQL scales vertically (by upgrading hardware) or horizontally (by sharding technique). NoSQL by nature can scale horizontally for huge datasets or traffic
- **Flexible data**: NoSQL supports unstructured data (json blobs, varying fields, etc.)
- **Performance**: like rapid writes (Cassandra), or caching in memory (Redis)
