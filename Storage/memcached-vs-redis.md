# Memcached vs. Redis Comparison

| Feature                | Memcached                                                                 | Redis                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**         | Simple, lightweight design. Minimal feature set focused on key-value caching. Easy to set up and use. | More complex, feature-rich. Supports advanced data structures and configurations. Steeper learning curve. |
| **Data Types**         | Basic key-value pairs (strings only). Maximum value size: 1MB. No native support for complex data structures. | Rich data types: strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, streams. Value size up to 512MB. |
| **Persistence**        | No persistence. Data is in-memory only and lost on server restart or crash. | Supports persistence via snapshots (RDB) and append-only files (AOF). Configurable durability options. Data can survive restarts. |
| **Use Cases**          | - High-speed caching for web apps (e.g., page caching, session storage).<br>- Temporary data storage.<br>- Simple key-value lookups. | - Caching (like Memcached).<br>- Real-time analytics (e.g., leaderboards, counters).<br>- Pub/sub messaging.<br>- Session management.<br>- Task queues.<br>- Geospatial applications. |
| **Performance**        | Extremely fast for simple key-value operations due to minimal overhead. Slightly better raw throughput for basic get/set (~100k–200k ops/sec on a single node). Multithreaded for high concurrency. | Comparable performance for simple operations (~100k–150k ops/sec). Slightly slower due to richer features and single-threaded core (but scales with clustering). Excels in complex operations (e.g., sorted sets, Lua scripting). |

## Notes
- **Memcached** is ideal for straightforward caching scenarios where simplicity and raw speed are priorities, and data loss on restart is acceptable.
- **Redis** is better for versatile applications needing complex data manipulation, persistence, or advanced features like pub/sub or geospatial queries.
