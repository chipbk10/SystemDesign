1. **Scale**
- how many (active) users and data are we expecting?
- is this for a small team or millions of users?

2. **Real-time collaboration**
- should multiple users can do some operations (read, write, delete) at the same time on the same data?
  
3. **Sharing mechanism**
- granting access (edit, view-only) - ACLs (access control lists)
- a `link-based sharing`:
  - public sharing - anyone with this link can see data
  - only logged-in users with the link can see
- `user-specific invites`: an authenticated user with the invitation link can see/edit data

4. **Persistence**
- how long should a data be stored?
- is there a need for version history?

6. **Security**
- users need to be authenticated to access our system?
- do we need to encrypt a raw data before storing in our database?
