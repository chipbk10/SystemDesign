- Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types - CRDT
  - pros: decentralized (no central server), support offline edit
  - cons: Complex implementation, higher storage for metadata

- CRDT vs OT
  - OT fits our 10-editor limit and centralized architecture, while CRDTs are overkill unless we need offline support, or support to 50 users editing at the same time
