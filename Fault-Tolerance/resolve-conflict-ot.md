- Operational Transformation - OT:
  - tranforms operations to resolve conflicts. For example, if User A inserts ‘x’ at position 100 and User B deletes position 100, OT adjusts the positions so both operations apply correctly.
  - pros: mature (Google Docs), simpler for centralized systems, low latency for small groups (5-10 users edit at the same time)
  - cons: requires a central server, complex for large-scale (e.g., 50 users edit at the same time) or offline edits
