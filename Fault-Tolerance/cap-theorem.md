- **CAP theorem** states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
- this means that in the face of **network partitions**, a system must choose between ensuring data **consistency** across all nodes or maintaining **availability** even if data might be temporarily inconsistent.
- **Consistency**: ensures that all clients see the same, up-to-date version of the data
- **Availability**: guarantees that every request receives a non-error response. It doesn't matter if the data might be stale. Itâ€™s about keeping the system responsive to clients
- **Partition Tolerance**: the system continues to operate despite the loss of messages between nodes
