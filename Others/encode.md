- **Encoding** is to convert data from one format to another

- ✅ Common Encoding Types in Web Context
  - **URL** Encoding (Percent-Encoding) → For query strings and form data.
  - **Base64** Encoding → For binary data in text-based protocols (e.g., sending images in JSON).
  - **HTML Entity** Encoding → For special characters in HTML (< → &lt;).
  - **UTF-8** Encoding → For international characters.

- **Decoding** reverses the process, converting the encoded data back to its original form
