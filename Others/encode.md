- **Encoding** is to convert data from one format to another
- For example, `base64 encoding` converts a binary sequence into text, where each group of 6 bits is mapped to a character from a set including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the symbols + and /.
- others: `ascii encoding`, `utf-8 encoding`, `iso-8859 encoding`
- applications: convert a binary data (e.g., an image) to a text to be imbeded in a json file
- **Decoding** reverses the process, converting the encoded data back to its original form
