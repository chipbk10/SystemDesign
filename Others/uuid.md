I.**Universally Unique Identifier - UUID?**
- a random 128 bits, typically represented as a 36-character string in hexadecimal format, split into five groups by hyphens (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)
- very low collision

II.**UUID version 1**
- contains timestamp, MAC address
- pros: sortable
- cons: expose MAC address, and generated time

III.**Application**
