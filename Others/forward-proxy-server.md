I. **Forward Proxy Server vs Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
1. **IP Masking / Anonymity**
- both can hide the client's IP from the destination server by using proxy's (or vpn) IP
    
2. **Bypassing Geo-Restrictions**
- both can bypass by routing the request through a server in a different location to access region-locked content
- for example, watching Netflix US from Europe - VPN works seamlessly
   
3. **Content Filtering**
- forward proxy can block or allow specific requests (e.g., blacklisting `facebook.com` in a corporate setting)
- vpn is not designed to filter. To make it work, `firewall` should be integrated

4. **Caching**
- forward proxy: stores responses (e.g., a webpage) to serve cached content faster
- vpn: don't cache content. They encrypt and forward traffic without storing it for reuse

5. **Access Control**
- forward proxy: can control which clients to access what (e.g., only certain client IPs can use proxy, and access `facebook.com`)
- vpn: differently. VPNs authenticate users/devices (e.g., via credentials or certificates) and control access to the VPN itself, not to specific destinations

6. **Traffic Inspection**
- forward proxy: can log or analyze requests
- vpn: no

7. **Selective Routing**
- forward proxy: only routes traffic for apps configured to use it (e.g., browser only)
- vpn: applys for the whole network

8. **Performance (Latency/Bandwidth)**
- forward proxy: can reduce latency for specific requests (via caching)
- vpn: adds encryption overhead, which might increase latency
