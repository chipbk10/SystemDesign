I.**Why WebSocket better than Long Polling**
- WebSockets offer a persistent, bidirectional connection over a single TCP socket, upgraded from HTTP. Compared to long polling, they win on:
  - Efficiency: No repeated HTTP requests—data flows freely once the connection’s open.
  - Latency: Real-time push with no polling delay.
  - Scalability: Fewer server resources tied up (no constant connection churn).
  - Simplicity for Real-Time: Ideal for chat, gaming, or live updates.

II.**But Long Polling Isn’t Dead**
- Long polling still hangs around because it’s not always practical or necessary to use WebSockets. Here’s why it’s still used in modern apps:
  
1. **Legacy Systems or Constraints**
- No WebSocket Support: Some older clients, proxies, or servers don’t support WebSockets (e.g., legacy enterprise systems or restrictive firewalls).
- HTTP Everywhere: Long polling works with standard HTTP infrastructure, requiring no protocol upgrades—handy when you can’t modify the stack.

2. **Simpler Setup**
- No Server Overhaul: Long polling can be bolted onto an existing HTTP API with minimal changes (just hold the response), while WebSockets need dedicated handling (e.g., a WebSocket server).
- Small Scale: For low-traffic apps, long polling’s overhead might not justify the complexity of WebSockets.

3. **Specific Use Cases**
- Intermittent Updates: If updates are rare (e.g., checking a job status every few minutes), long polling can suffice without a persistent connection.
- Fallback Mechanism: Some apps use long polling as a backup when WebSocket connections fail (e.g., SignalR in .NET defaults to long polling if WebSockets aren’t available).

4. **Compatibility**
- Browser or Network Issues: In environments where WebSocket connections are unreliable (e.g., spotty mobile networks), long polling’s HTTP nature can be more robust since it retries naturally with each request.

III.**The Trend**
- In modern apps, WebSockets (or even Server-Sent Events for unidirectional push) dominate where real-time matters—think chat apps (WhatsApp, Discord), live sports scores, or collaborative tools (Google Docs). Long polling is rarely the first choice for greenfield projects with real-time needs. But it’s not “never used”—it’s more of a pragmatic fallback or niche solution.

IV.**Interview Angle**
- **When Asked:** “I’d use WebSockets for a real-time chat app due to efficiency, but long polling could work if the client doesn’t support WebSockets or the updates are infrequent.”
- **Trade-off**: “Long polling is simpler to implement over HTTP but less scalable than WebSockets due to connection overhead.”
