### ✅ Shared Responsibility Model

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines **who is responsible for what** in cloud security:

*   **AWS Responsibility (Security *of* the Cloud)**  
    AWS secures the infrastructure that runs all services:
    *   Physical facilities
    *   Hardware and networking
    *   Global infrastructure

*   **Customer Responsibility (Security *in* the Cloud)**  
    Customers secure what they put in the cloud:
    *   Data encryption
    *   IAM (users, roles, policies)
    *   OS and application configuration

Goal: **AWS manages the cloud, you manage what you run in it.**
