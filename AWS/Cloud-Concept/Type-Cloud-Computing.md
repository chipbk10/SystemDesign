### **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

*   Provides the basic building blocks of cloud IT: networking, virtual or dedicated servers, and storage.
*   Offers the **highest level of flexibility and control** over IT resources.
*   Closest to traditional on-premises systems, but without hardware procurement and maintenance. [\[aws.amazon.com\]](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

*   Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure like hardware and operating systems.
*   Enables you to focus on **building and deploying applications** without worrying about resource provisioning, patching, or capacity planning. [\[aws.amazon.com\]](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

*   Provides fully managed software applications delivered by the vendor.
*   You only consume the software—no need to handle deployment, infrastructure, or feature updates.
*   Example: web-based email, where the provider handles servers, OS, and maintenance. [\[aws.amazon.com\]](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

These three models represent increasing levels of abstraction and reduced operational responsibility:

*   **IaaS** → full control, full responsibility
*   **PaaS** → some control, less responsibility
*   **SaaS** → minimal control, minimal responsibility
