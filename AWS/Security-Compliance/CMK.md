Here’s a **short explanation of CMK**:

A **Customer Managed Key (CMK)** in **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** is an encryption key that **you create and control**. AWS hosts it securely, but you manage its lifecycle, permissions, and usage. With CMKs, you can:

*   **Create** symmetric or asymmetric keys.
*   **Control access** via key policies and IAM.
*   **Enable rotation** (automatic yearly).
*   **Audit usage** through CloudTrail.
*   Use it for **encrypting data** in AWS services like S3, EBS, RDS, or in your own applications.

✅ **Key point:** You own and manage the key; AWS only provides the secure infrastructure.
