## ✅ AWS Pricing Calculator

- **What it is**: A free AWS tool that lets you estimate the cost of AWS services before you deploy them.
- **Purpose**: Helps you plan and forecast costs based on:
  - **Services** (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
  - **Usage** (compute hours, storage size, data transfer)
  - **Region** and **configuration**
- **Key point**: It gives estimates only (monthly cost), not your actual bill.
