## ✅ AWS Cost Explorer

- **What it is**: A tool to visualize and analyze your actual AWS spending.
- **Purpose**:
  - See historical usage and costs.
  - Identify trends and cost drivers.
  - Filter by service, region, linked accounts.
- **Key point**: Helps you understand where your money is going.

## ✅ AWS Budgets

- **What it is**: A tool to set custom cost and usage budgets.
- **Purpose**:
  - Define a monthly/quarterly budget for AWS costs or usage.
  - Get alerts (via email or SNS) when you exceed or forecast to exceed your budget.
- **Key point**: Helps you control spending proactively.

## ✅ AWS Budgets vs Cost Explorer (Why separate tools?)
- AWS designed Budgets for proactive alerts and Cost Explorer for analysis.
- Combining them could make the UI complex because:
  - Cost Explorer focuses on data visualization.
  - Budgets focuses on threshold-based notifications.
- AWS keeps them separate for clarity and specialized use cases.
