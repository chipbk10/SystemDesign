- **Pricing Models**:
    - **On-Demand**: pay-as-you-go (per **minute**), no discount, best for short-term, unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - **Reserved**: 1-3 years term, discount 72%, best for steady-state or predictable workloads
    - **Spot**: unused EC2 capacity, discount 90%, can be interrupted by AWS when capacity is needed
    - **Saving Plans**: commit to a consistent amount of usage (in $ per hour) for 1 or 3 years, beyond that you pay as you go
    - **Dedicated Host** - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host allows you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. It is not cost-efficient compared to an **On-Demand** instance.
