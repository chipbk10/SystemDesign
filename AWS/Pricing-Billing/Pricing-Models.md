    - **On-Demand**: pay-as-you-go, no discount, best for short-term, unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted

    - **Spot**: unused EC2 capacity, discount 90%, can be interrupted by AWS when capacity is needed
    - **Saving Plans**: commit to a consistent amount of usage (in $ per hour) for 1 or 3 years, beyond that you pay as you go
