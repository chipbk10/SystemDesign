### ✅ **What It Means**

*   If you subscribe to the **Enterprise Support Plan** (the highest AWS support tier), you get access to a **Concierge Support Team**.
*   This team is **not technical support**—they focus on **account management, billing, and cost optimization**.
*   They act like your **personal account managers** for AWS.

***

### ✅ **Example Scenario**

*   You run a large company with **50 AWS accounts** under **AWS Organizations**.
*   Your monthly AWS bill is $100,000, and you want to:
    *   Understand why costs spiked this month.
    *   Consolidate billing across accounts.
    *   Set up **AWS Budgets** and **Cost Explorer** for forecasting.
*   Instead of figuring it out yourself, you contact the **Concierge Support Team**:
    *   They review your bill.
    *   Suggest **Reserved Instances** or **Savings Plans** to reduce costs.
    *   Help you configure consolidated billing for all accounts.
    *   Answer questions about **tax invoices, payment methods, and enterprise agreements**.

✅ **Key Point**:  
Concierge = **billing and account experts**, not engineers.  
For technical issues, you still use **AWS Technical Support** (also included in Enterprise plan).
