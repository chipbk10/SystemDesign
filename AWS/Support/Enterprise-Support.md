*   **Business Support** gives you 24/7 access to AWS engineers and fast response times if something breaks. However, it’s **reactive**—you call AWS when you have an issue.
*   **Enterprise Support** is **proactive**. You get:
    *   A **Technical Account Manager (TAM)** who helps plan and optimize your architecture weeks before the event.
    *   **Infrastructure Event Management (IEM)** sessions to simulate traffic spikes and prepare scaling strategies.
    *   Priority response (<15 min for critical issues) and post-event reviews.

So, with Business Support, you’re on your own for **planning and stress testing**. If your team is experienced and has done similar events before, Business Support might be enough. But if the event is **mission-critical and downtime costs millions**, Enterprise Support is the safer choice.
