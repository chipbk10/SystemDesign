### ✅ **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) – Simple Explanation**

The **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework** is a **structured approach** that helps organizations move to the cloud successfully. It provides **guidance across six perspectives** (business, people, governance, platform, security, operations) to ensure both technical and organizational readiness.

Think of it as a **roadmap** for cloud migration that covers:

*   **Strategy** (Why move?)
*   **People & Processes** (Who and how?)
*   **Technology** (What to migrate and how to build?)

***

### ✅ **Example**

A **bank** wants to migrate its on-premise applications to AWS:

1.  **Business Perspective**: Define goals (reduce costs, improve agility).
2.  **People Perspective**: Train staff on AWS services.
3.  **Governance Perspective**: Set compliance and cost controls.
4.  **Platform Perspective**: Design architecture (VPC, EC2, RDS).
5.  **Security Perspective**: Implement IAM, encryption, monitoring.
6.  **Operations Perspective**: Set up monitoring (CloudWatch), incident response.

Result: A **structured migration plan** that aligns technology with business objectives.

👉 Do you want me to **create a simple diagram showing the 6 CAF perspectives and their focus areas**? Or a **table mapping each perspective to AWS services used in migration**?
