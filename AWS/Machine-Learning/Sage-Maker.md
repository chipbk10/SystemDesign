### ✅ What SageMaker Does

1.  **Build** – Prepare data and develop your ML model using Jupyter notebooks.
2.  **Train** – Train the model on scalable infrastructure (CPU/GPU).
3.  **Deploy** – Create an **HTTPS endpoint** that acts like a web service.
4.  **Inference** – Applications can send data to this endpoint and get predictions in real time.

So yes, after deployment, SageMaker gives you a **fully managed API endpoint** for inference without you having to manage servers.
