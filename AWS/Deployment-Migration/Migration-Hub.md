## ✅ AWS Migration Hub
- **AWS Migration Hub** is a central service that helps you track and manage application migrations to AWS.
- It doesn’t actually perform the migration itself; instead, it provides a single dashboard to monitor progress across multiple migration tools (like AWS Application Migration Service, Database Migration Service, etc.).
- Think of it as the control center for your migration projects.
