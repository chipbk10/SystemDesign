### ✅ AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

AWS DMS is a managed service that **helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely**. It supports:

*   **Homogeneous migrations** (e.g., MySQL → MySQL)
*   **Heterogeneous migrations** (e.g., Oracle → PostgreSQL)
*   Continuous data replication with minimal downtime.

You only need to:

*   Set up a **source database** (on-prem or cloud)
*   Set up a **target database** (AWS RDS, Aurora, etc.)
*   Configure a **replication instance** in DMS.
