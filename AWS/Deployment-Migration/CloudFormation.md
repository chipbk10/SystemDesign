## ✅ What is AWS CloudFormation?
- **AWS CloudFormation** is a service that lets you define and provision AWS resources using templates (written in JSON or YAML).
- Instead of creating resources manually, you describe them in a template, and CloudFormation automates the setup.
- Think of it as **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) for AWS.

## 🔍 Why is it useful?
- **Consistency**: Deploy the same environment repeatedly.
- **Automation**: No manual clicks in the console.
- **Version control**: Templates can be stored in Git.
