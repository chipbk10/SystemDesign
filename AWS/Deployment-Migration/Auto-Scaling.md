## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.
- You create collections of Amazon EC2 instances, called **Auto Scaling groups**.
- You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size.
