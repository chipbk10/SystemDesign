**AWS Wavelength** is an AWS service that brings **AWS compute and storage services to the edge of 5G networks**, provided by telecom carriers.

### ✅ **Purpose**

*   Deploy applications that require **ultra-low latency** (like AR/VR, IoT, autonomous vehicles, real-time gaming).
*   By placing AWS infrastructure inside telecom data centers, traffic doesn’t need to travel to a distant AWS Region — reducing latency to **single-digit milliseconds**.

***

### **How it works**

*   You create **Wavelength Zones**, which are extensions of an AWS Region inside a telecom network.
*   You can run **EC2, EBS, VPC, and other services** in these zones.
*   Integrated with your existing AWS account and tools.

✅ **Key Benefit:**  
**Ultra-low latency for mobile and edge applications** by combining AWS cloud with 5G networks.
