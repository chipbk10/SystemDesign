- **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a block-level storage service for use with EC2 instances.
- It provides **persistent storage**: data remains even after the instance stops or terminates.
- Volumes are **network-attached**, not physically tied to the EC2 host.
- EBS, and EC2 are tied to a single AZ
- a snapshot of EBS is stored on S3, can be used to recover in case the AZ fails or gets corrupted
- EBS uses AWS network protocol (not HTTP) to transfer data to EC2
- we can attach multiple EBS to one EC2 instance
- EBS can be used to store **a root volume** (OS, and boot files), local database (like MySQL)
