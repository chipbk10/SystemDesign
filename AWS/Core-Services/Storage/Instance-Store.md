The two AWS services that offer **block-level storage** are:

### ✅ **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

*   Provides block storage volumes for **EC2 instances**.
*   Ideal for databases, file systems, and applications requiring low-latency access.

### ✅ **AWS Instance Store**

*   Temporary block storage that comes **physically attached** to the EC2 host.
*   High performance, but data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.

***

**Other storage types for context:**

*   **Amazon S3** → Object storage (not block-level).
*   **Amazon EFS** → File storage (not block-level).
*   **Amazon FSx** → Managed file systems (not block-level).
