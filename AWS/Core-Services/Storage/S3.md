## ✅ Amazon S3 (Simple Explanation)

- What it is: A scalable object storage service for storing files (objects) in buckets.
- Key Features:
  - Stores any type of data (images, videos, backups, logs).
  - Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). **S3 replicate data across multiple Availability Zones**
  - Access: Objects are retrieved using Bucket + Key.
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Best for: Static files, backups, big data, media storage.

## Important Notes
- bucket name is globally unique, across all AWS accounts
- S3 is not a database, doesn't support queries (like SQL, or range query)
- S3 is billed by number of requests and data transfer out
- S3 supports security features like Encryption at rest and in transit, IAM policies, bucket policies.
- S3 **is tied to region**

## Analogy
- think of a **bucket** as **a logical container** (like a namespace or folder) in a global storage system, not a physical object (like computer or hard disk)
- S3 **bucket** is **virtual and distributed**: data is stored across multiple servers and AZs for durability and scalability
- inside the bucket, objects are stored as **key-value pairs**
- AWS handles replication, durability, and performance behind the scenes for you
