- Lambda is a **serverless** compute service that runs your code without **provisioning** or managing servers.
- Use case: short-running tasks, microservices, automation
- Key Features:
  - Event-driven: trigger from S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway
  - Automatic scaling
  - No infrastructure management
- Billing based on number of requests and execution time (**maximum is 15 minutes**)
- Main idea is you provide code, and AWS takes care of the runtime environment (OS, language runtime, security patches) for you
