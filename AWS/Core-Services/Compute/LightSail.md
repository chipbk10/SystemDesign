### **Amazon Lightsail**

*   A **simplified VPS (Virtual Private Server)** service from AWS.
*   Gives you pre-configured virtual machines with fixed pricing.
*   You manage the OS, runtime, and application yourself.
*   Great for small websites, blogs, or simple apps without complex scaling needs.

### **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

*   A **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**.
*   You just deploy your application code; AWS handles provisioning, scaling, and monitoring.
*   Ideal for developers who want to focus on code, not infrastructure.

***

**Key Difference:**

*   **Lightsail** = You manage servers and environment (like renting a ready-to-use VM).
*   **Beanstalk** = AWS manages servers and scaling for you (you only manage your app).
