**Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)** is an AWS service for **big data processing and analytics**. It provides a managed cluster platform that makes it easy to run frameworks like:

*   **Apache Hadoop**
*   **Apache Spark**
*   **Presto**
*   **Hive**, **HBase**, and others

### Key Features:

*   **Purpose**: Process and analyze large datasets efficiently.
*   **Scalable**: You can add or remove nodes dynamically.
*   **Cost-efficient**: Uses EC2 instances and can leverage Spot Instances for savings.
*   **Integrates with S3**: Store input/output data in Amazon S3.
*   **Use cases**:
    *   Data transformation (ETL)
    *   Machine learning pipelines
    *   Log analysis
    *   Data lake processing

Essentially, EMR is for **distributed data processing** using open-source big data frameworks without having to manage the cluster manually.
