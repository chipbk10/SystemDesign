- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is used for running virtual servers (called **instances**) in the cloud
- Key features:
  - **On-demand instances**: pay only for what you use
  - **Scalability**: easily scale up and down
  - **Instance types**: different configurations for CPU, memory, storage, and networking
  - **Pricing Models**:
    - **On-Demand**: pay-as-you-go, no discount, best for short-term, unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - **Reserved**: 1-3 years term, discount 72%, best for steady-state or predictable workloads
    - **Spot**: unused EC2 capacity, discount 90%, can be interrupted by AWS when capacity is needed
    - **Saving Plans**: commit to a consistent amount of usage (in $ per hour) for 1 or 3 years, beyond that you pay as you go
  - **Region and Availability Zones**: choose where your instances run for redundancy and low latency
- Use case:
  - can be used for hosting application, running workload, or replacing physical server

- an EC2 instance **is tied to a single AZ** only
