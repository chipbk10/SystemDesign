### ✅ **High Availability (HA)**

*   **Goal**: Keep systems running with minimal downtime.
*   **How**: Redundant resources, multi-AZ deployments, failover mechanisms.
*   **Example**: Deploying an app across multiple AWS Availability Zones so if one fails, traffic shifts automatically.

***

### ✅ **Agility**

*   **Goal**: Respond quickly to changes in business or technology.
*   **How**: Use managed services, automation, CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Example**: Spinning up new environments in minutes instead of weeks.

***

### ✅ **Scalability**

*   **Goal**: Handle growth in traffic or data without redesigning the system.
*   **How**: Auto Scaling, serverless services, distributed architectures.
*   **Example**: EC2 Auto Scaling adds instances when traffic spikes.

***

### ✅ **Other Important Principles**

*   **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating even if components fail.
*   **Elasticity**: Scale **up or down** automatically based on demand. Scaling here refers to both Horizontal (out&in) and Vertical (up&down)
*   **Security**: Protect data and workloads using IAM, encryption, and compliance.
*   **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for what you use; leverage Spot Instances, Reserved Instances.
*   **Performance Efficiency**: Optimize resources for speed and responsiveness.

These terms—**High Availability, Agility, Scalability, Fault Tolerance, Elasticity, Security, Cost Optimization, Performance Efficiency**—fall under the topic of **AWS Well-Architected Framework**.

### ✅ **AWS Well-Architected Framework**

It’s a set of **best practices and design principles** for building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure in the cloud. It has **six pillars**:

1.  **Operational Excellence** – Agility, automation, monitoring.
2.  **Security** – Protecting data and systems.
3.  **Reliability** – High Availability, Fault Tolerance.
4.  **Performance Efficiency** – Scalability, elasticity.
5.  **Cost Optimization** – Efficient resource usage.
6.  **Sustainability** – Minimizing environmental impact.
