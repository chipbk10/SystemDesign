### ✅ Performance Efficiency Pillar (AWS Well-Architected Framework)

The **Performance Efficiency pillar** focuses on **using IT and computing resources efficiently** and adapting to changing requirements. It emphasizes:

*   Selecting the **right resource types and sizes**.
*   Leveraging **managed services** to reduce overhead.
*   Using **scalable architectures** that can grow or shrink based on demand.
*   Continually **monitoring and improving performance**.

Goal: **Deliver optimal performance at the lowest cost while staying flexible.**
