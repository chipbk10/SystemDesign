### ✅ Sustainability Pillar (AWS Well-Architected Framework)

The **Sustainability pillar** focuses on **minimizing the environmental impact of running workloads in the cloud**. It emphasizes:

*   **Optimizing resource usage** to reduce energy consumption.
*   **Choosing efficient architectures** (e.g., serverless, containers).
*   **Using managed services** that share infrastructure for better efficiency.
*   **Monitoring and improving sustainability metrics**.

Goal: **Reduce carbon footprint and energy waste while maintaining performance.**
