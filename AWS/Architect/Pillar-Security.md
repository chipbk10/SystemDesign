### ✅ Security Pillar (AWS Well-Architected Framework)

The **Security pillar** focuses on **protecting data, systems, and assets** in the cloud. It includes:

*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – Control who can access what.
*   **Data Protection** – Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
*   **Infrastructure Protection** – Use security groups, network ACLs, and firewalls.
*   **Detective Controls** – Monitor and log activity (CloudTrail, GuardDuty).
*   **Incident Response** – Prepare and automate responses to security events.

Goal: **Keep workloads secure while maintaining compliance and minimizing risk.**
