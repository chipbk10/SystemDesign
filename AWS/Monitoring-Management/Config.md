## ✅ What is AWS Config?
- **AWS Config** is a service that tracks the configuration of your AWS resources over time and checks them against compliance rules.
- Think of it as a configuration history and compliance auditor for your AWS environment.
  - It records what resources exist, their settings, and changes.
  - You can define rules (e.g., “S3 buckets must not be public”) and get alerts if something violates them.

## 🔍 Why is it useful?
- **Compliance**: Ensure resources meet security or governance standards.
- **Troubleshooting**: See what changed before an issue occurred.
- **Auditing**: Maintain a history of resource configurations.
