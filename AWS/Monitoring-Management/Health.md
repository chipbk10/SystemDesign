### ✅ **AWS Health**

AWS Health is a service that gives you **personalized alerts and status updates** about the health of AWS services **that you use**.  
It tells you if there are **issues, maintenance events, or changes** that might affect your resources.

***

### ✅ **Use Cases**

*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Know when AWS services in your region have problems.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Quickly check if an outage is AWS-related.
*   **Compliance & Planning:** Get notifications about upcoming maintenance or deprecations.

***

### ✅ **Without AWS Health**

*   Your workloads will still run fine.
*   But you **won’t get personalized alerts**—you’d have to rely on the general **AWS Service Status page**, which is less specific.
*   AWS Health is **especially useful for production environments** where uptime matters.
