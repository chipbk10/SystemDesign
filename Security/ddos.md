I.**Distributed denial-of-service (ddos) attack**:
- a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic
- the `distributed` aspect means that the attack comes from multiple sources, often thousands or even millions of devices, making it harder to defend against compared to a single-source attack
