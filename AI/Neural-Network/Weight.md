- Weights tell the network **how important each input is**
  - Imagine you’re predicting whether someone will buy a product. Inputs could be age, income, and browsing time.
  - Not all inputs matter equally (e.g., income might matter more than age)
  - Higher weight means more influence
- Without weights, every input would contribute equally, which is rarely true in real-world data.
