## Difference Between Loss Function and Cost Function

- **Loss Function**: Measures the error for a **single training example**.
  - Example)²`.

- **Cost Function**: Represents the **average loss over the entire training set** (or a batch).
  - Example: For `n` data points,  
    `Cost = (1/n) * Σ (ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²`.

### In short:
- Loss = error per sample.
- Cost = overall error (objective function we minimize during training).
