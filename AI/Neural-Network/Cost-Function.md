## Cost Function in AI

A **cost function** measures how far a model's predictions are from the actual values. It gives a single number representing the overall error for all training examples.

The goal of training is to **minimize the cost function**, so the model becomes more accurate.

Example (Mean Squared Error for regression):

Cost = (1/n) * Σ (ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²

Lower cost = better model performance.
