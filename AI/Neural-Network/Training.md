- At the start, the weights are random.
- Through [backpropagation]() and [gradient descent]() the network adjust the weights so predictions become more accurate
- After training, the **final set of weights** is what defines your trained model. **These weights encode all the patterns the network discovered in the data.**
- in short: **training = finding the right weights**
