**Pure LLM**  
A Pure LLM is a large neural network trained to predict the next word (or token) one by one based on the input text it receives. It generates responses purely from patterns it learned during training, without any external help, memory of past conversations, or ability to access real-time information. This makes it excellent at creative writing, translation, or answering general knowledge questions, but it is completely "frozen in time" and cannot know anything that happened after its training cutoff.

**AI Workflow**  
An AI Workflow is a structured, pre-defined sequence of steps where one or more LLM calls are combined with other actions in a fixed order. For example, it might first classify the user's question, then search a database, then summarize the results, and finally format a nice response — all following the exact same path every time. Workflows are reliable and efficient for repetitive, predictable tasks, but they are rigid and cannot adapt if something unexpected happens during execution.

**AI Agent**  
An AI Agent is an autonomous system powered by an LLM that can think, plan, decide which tools to use, and take multiple steps on its own to achieve a goal. Instead of following a fixed script, it observes the results of its actions, reflects on them, and adjusts its plan — sometimes looping several times until the task is complete. This makes agents flexible and powerful for complex, open-ended problems, such as planning a trip, debugging code, or researching current events, where the exact steps are not known in advance.
