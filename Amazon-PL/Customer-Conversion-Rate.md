### What is Customer Conversion Rate?

**Simple words:**  
It's the % of people who visit your site, store, or ad—and then buy something (or take the action you want, like signing up).

**Formula:**  
(Conversions ÷ Total Visitors) × 100  
Example: 50 sales from 1,000 visitors = 5%.

**Easy example:**  
Your online shop gets 200 people. 10 buy stuff. Rate = 5%.  
Higher rate = better sales from your traffic.  

Track it to fix weak spots, like slow pages or bad ads.
