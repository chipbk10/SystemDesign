## 🗣️ Scenario: The Data Discrepancy (Testing Trust vs. Detail)

You are reviewing metrics for a new product launch led by a respected, tenured senior engineer. You discover a slight, but consistent, discrepancy in the data, suggesting the customer conversion rate might be 1% lower than reported. The difference is small and difficult to prove, but could impact a multi-million-dollar marketing decision next week.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Assume the data discrepancy is minor noise and let the marketing team proceed with the launch decision.
* **B.** Spend the next two days **Diving Deep** to prove the discrepancy, delaying the marketing decision until the data is validated.
* **C.** Immediately alert your manager and the senior engineer privately about the potential discrepancy and the need for a quick review before the marketing meeting.
* **D.** Send an email to the entire organization, including executives, stating that the conversion metrics are likely flawed and the launch must be paused.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **C** | **Earn Trust; Dive Deep; Bias for Action** | This is the best balance. It uses **Dive Deep** skills to find the issue, uses **Bias for Action** to alert stakeholders quickly, and most importantly, uses **Earn Trust** by raising the concern respectfully and privately to the relevant parties first. |
| **2** | **B** | **Dive Deep; Insist on the Highest Standards** | Strong focus on quality, but violates **Bias for Action** by failing to communicate the risk immediately. Delaying a major decision without initial communication can erode trust. |
| **3** | **A** | **Ownership** | Violates **Ownership** and **Insist on the Highest Standards**. Ignoring data that could impact a multi-million-dollar decision is irresponsible. |
| **4** | **D** | **Earn Trust; Have Backbone** | While it shows some **Have Backbone**, violating **Earn Trust** by publicly escalating a small, unproven discrepancy (a "fire drill") without attempting to solve it privately first is poor leadership. |
