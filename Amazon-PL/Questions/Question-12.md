## 1. 📚 Scenario: The Legacy Tool Upgrade (Testing Learn/Curious vs. Bias for Action)

Your team uses a critical, legacy internal tool (Tool X) that is difficult to maintain but gets the job done. A new, modern technology stack has emerged (Tool Y) that is 10 times faster and more reliable, but no one on your team knows how to use it. Learning and migrating to Tool Y would take one full sprint (two weeks).

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Immediately dedicate one full sprint to train the team on Tool Y and migrate the legacy tool, blocking all feature work.
* **B.** Continue using Tool X to avoid delaying the current feature delivery, while assigning one engineer to use 10% of their time each week to learn Tool Y and report findings later.
* **C.** Allocate time in the current sprint to hire an external contractor who is an expert in Tool Y to perform the migration quickly.
* **D.** Decide Tool X is "good enough" for now and ignore Tool Y, as the immediate business need is feature delivery.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **B** | **Learn and Be Curious; Bias for Action; Frugality** | This is the most balanced approach. It prioritizes **Bias for Action** by not stopping all feature work, while still upholding **Learn and Be Curious** and **Invent and Simplify** by initiating the learning process internally. It is also **Frugal** by using internal resources. |
| **2** | **A** | **Learn and Be Curious; Invent and Simplify** | This demonstrates strong **Insist on the Highest Standards** and **Learn and Be Curious** by fully committing to the long-term solution. However, it severely violates **Bias for Action** and **Deliver Results** by causing an abrupt, full-stop on all feature delivery, which is usually not acceptable. |
| **3** | **C** | **Bias for Action; Frugality** | Violates **Frugality** (hiring a costly specialist) and **Hire and Develop the Best** (misses an internal training opportunity). While fast, Amazon usually prefers investing in their employees' skill development over external contractors for core competency gaps. |
| **4** | **D** | **Learn and Be Curious; Invent and Simplify** | Violates **Learn and Be Curious** and **Invent and Simplify** by accepting the status quo. Ignoring a 10x improvement opportunity is classic "thinking small." |
