## 3. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Scenario: The Unproductive Teammate (Testing Trust vs. Develop the Best)

A peer engineer on your team is consistently delivering low-quality code and is missing deadlines, negatively impacting your sprint delivery. Your manager is unaware of the full extent of the issue.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Quietly offer to help the teammate with their remaining tasks and fix their submitted code issues yourself to ensure the sprint is completed on time.
* **B.** Immediately schedule a meeting with your manager to explain the performance issues and ask for the teammate to be moved to another project.
* **C.** Privately and respectfully offer to peer-review the teammate's tasks early and frequently, while also notifying your manager of the delivery risk and offering a plan to mentor them.
* **D.** Speak to the teammate in a public setting about the issues, making it clear their poor performance is blocking the team.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **C** | **Earn Trust; Hire and Develop the Best; Ownership** | The most effective solution. You first **Earn Trust** by approaching the peer respectfully and privately. You then demonstrate **Ownership** and commit to **Hiring and Developing the Best** by offering mentorship, while also ensuring the manager is aware of the risk (the data). |
| **2** | **A** | **Deliver Results** | This prioritizes short-term **Deliver Results** but fails to solve the root problem. It violates **Hire and Develop the Best** by doing the work *for* the peer instead of helping them improve, and violates **Ownership** by concealing a systemic team risk. |
| **3** | **B** | **Earn Trust** | While the manager needs to be informed, immediately requesting removal violates the developmental aspect of **Hire and Develop the Best** and shows a low commitment to mentoring, which damages the team's sense of **Earn Trust**. |
| **4** | **D** | **Earn Trust** | Highly violates **Earn Trust**. Public confrontation is disrespectful, unprofessional, and guarantees future lack of cooperation, making the situation worse. |
