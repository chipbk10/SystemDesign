## 2. 💡 Scenario: The Data-Driven Disagreement (Testing Are Right, A Lot vs. Customer Obsession)

Your team has analyzed large volumes of user data and determined that customers primarily use Feature A. Your manager wants to spend the next quarter adding complex new features to Feature B, based on an informal request from a high-level executive. The data shows Feature B has only 5% usage.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Agree to the manager's plan to avoid conflict and build the features for Feature B as quickly as possible.
* **B.** Quietly use your team's reserve capacity to enhance Feature A with high-impact fixes while still officially working on Feature B.
* **C.** Present the manager with the usage data (Feature A: 80%, Feature B: 5%) and propose a compromise to dedicate a small amount of time to Feature B while focusing most effort on Feature A.
* **D.** Immediately challenge the executive's request via email, copying your manager and other stakeholders to highlight the data.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **C** | **Have Backbone; Are Right, A Lot; Customer Obsession** | This is the most effective approach. You use **Are Right, A Lot** by backing your stance with data. You use **Have Backbone** to respectfully challenge the decision, and the proposed compromise aligns resources with both the data (**Customer Obsession**) and the executive's request. |
| **2** | **B** | **Customer Obsession; Ownership** | Shows dedication to **Customer Obsession** and **Ownership** by trying to fix the right problem. However, it violates **Earn Trust** by implementing a stealth plan that contradicts the official agreed-upon direction. |
| **3** | **A** | **Have Backbone** | Directly violates **Have Backbone** and **Are Right, A Lot**. Ignoring data to prioritize comfort is highly discouraged, as it wastes resources and hurts customers. |
| **4** | **D** | **Earn Trust; Have Backbone** | Violates **Earn Trust** by publicly escalating the issue and making the manager look bad. Disagreement must be respectful and targeted, not broad and confrontational. |
