# Think Big

## Rejects "Thinking Small"
- Amazon belives that thinking small leads to limited results.

| Focus Area | Thinking Small (Avoid) | Thinking Big (Goal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Design** | Building a service that meets the requirements for next month's launch and nothing more.| Building a flexible, microservice-based architecture that can easily be **reused** by five other teams and **handle 10x the traffic** within two years. |
| **Feature Scope** | Implementing only the minimal features requested in the product requirement document (PRD).| Challenging the PRD with a slightly larger, bolder feature that could **fundamentally change how customers use the product**. |
| **Code Review** | Focusing only on fixing bugs in the submitted code.| Reviewing the code and suggesting a new design pattern or library that would **speed up development across the entire organization**.|
