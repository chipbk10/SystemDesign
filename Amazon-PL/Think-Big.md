## Rejects "Thinking Small"

- Amazon belives that thinking small leads to limited results.

| Focus Area | Thinking Small (Avoid) | Thinking Big (Goal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Design** | Building a service that meets the requirements for next month's launch and nothing more.| Building a flexible, microservice-based architecture that can easily be **reused** by five other teams and **handle 10x the traffic** within two years. |
| **Feature Scope** | Implementing only the minimal features requested in the product requirement document (PRD).| Challenging the PRD with a slightly larger, bolder feature that could **fundamentally change how customers use the product**. |
| **Code Review** | Focusing only on fixing bugs in the submitted code.| Reviewing the code and suggesting a new design pattern or library that would **speed up development across the entire organization**.|

## Encourage to Think Big

- Amazon wants leaders to **Think Big** and set goals that are challenging and ambitious. The teams are forced to [Invent and Simplify](). They must challenge assumptions, redesign the architecture, and look for completely new solutions. This way leads to larger outcomes.

## Blancing Think Big with Reality

1. **Vision**
- When a team receives a request, the team should have a vision, meaning always Think Big first. This ensures you don't limit the product's future by solving the current problem too narrowly. For example:
  - **What is the 10x version of this request?** What if we implement a perfect solution, that can fundamentally change the customer experience in five years?
  - **Is this a stepping stone?** Does this small request fit into a larger, more ambitious vision for the product or service?
  - **Is the current design scalable?** Will the system handle a global rollout or 100x traffic without major redesign?

2. **Implementation**
- Once you have the big vision, the implementation must be adjusted by other LPs:
  - **[Bias for Action]()**: The market often requires fast delivery. You should implement the simplest, cleanest solution that enables the big vision later without compromising the immediate launch.
  - **[Frugality]()**: You shouldn't spend a year and ten million dollars on a complex system if a 90% solution can be launched in a month for minimal cost. The effort spent must be justified by the expected return
  - **[Insist on the Highest Standard]()**: The solution you launch - even if it's not the final (biggest vision), it must still be well-tested, bug-free, and maintainable
 
## Conclusion
- The most "Amazonian" approach is to **design big, but implement iteratively and frugally**
