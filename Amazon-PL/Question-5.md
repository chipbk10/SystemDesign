## 👥 Scenario: The Undeliverable Feature (Testing Backbone vs. Results)

Your team has committed to delivering three major features this sprint. Halfway through, you realize that two of the three features are far more complex than estimated, and you can only deliver one high-quality feature by the deadline. Your manager insists you deliver all three, even if it means sacrificing testing.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Work weekends and nights to try and ship all three, even if the quality suffers slightly.
* **B.** Inform your manager you can only ship one feature, provide a data-driven breakdown of the remaining work, and ask them to prioritize which one gets done.
* **C.** Deliver two low-quality features and document the known bugs for the testing team to discover later.
* **D.** Immediately challenge the manager's commitment in a public team meeting to get the decision overturned by peers.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **B** | **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit; Insist on the Highest Standards** | The most effective approach. You use **Have Backbone** to respectfully push back with data, and you uphold **Insist on the Highest Standards** by refusing to compromise quality. This allows the manager to make an informed, prioritized decision. |
| **2** | **A** | **Deliver Results; Ownership** | Shows dedication, but directly violates **Insist on the Highest Standards** and can lead to burnout. Amazon prefers sustainable high quality over rushed, heroic efforts. |
| **3** | **C** | **Insist on the Highest Standards; Deliver Results** | Violates **Insist on the Highest Standards** (by knowingly shipping bugs) and **Earn Trust** (by misleading the testing team). |
| **4** | **D** | **Earn Trust** | Highly violates **Earn Trust** and is unprofessional. Pushing back must be respectful and targeted, not public and aggressive. |
