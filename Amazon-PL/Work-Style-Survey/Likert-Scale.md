## 📊 Likert Scale Examples

These questions present a statement, and you are asked to rate your agreement or disagreement on a scale (e.g., Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). Look for statements that align directly with the LPs.

| LP Tested | Statement Example | Desired Rating (Why) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Insist on the Highest Standards** | "I frequently ask my team members to redo work if it does not meet my quality expectations." | **Strongly Agree.** This shows you constantly raise the bar and are unwilling to accept low-quality work. |
| **Customer Obsession** | "I am more concerned with internal system performance than with the visible user experience." | **Strongly Disagree.** Customer experience must always be prioritized over internal convenience. |
| **Dive Deep** | "Before starting a project, I always spend a significant amount of time reading all the related technical documentation." | **Strongly Agree.** A good SDE must know the details and audit systems frequently. |
| **Earn Trust** | "If I made an error that caused a production issue, I would only tell my manager if the issue was severe." | **Strongly Disagree.** **Earn Trust** requires transparency and candor—you must disclose all errors, regardless of severity. |
| **Ownership** | "I often wait for clear direction from my manager before beginning a new, ambiguous task." | **Strongly Disagree.** A leader with **Ownership** takes initiative and figures things out, rather than waiting for instructions. |
