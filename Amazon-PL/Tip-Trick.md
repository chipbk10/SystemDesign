- **Tech Debt** aligns with [Invent And Simplify]() (improving processes), and [Think Big]() (investing in scalable solution or better impacts). It shows a long-term vision but often comes after direct customer value ([Customer Obsession]())
- **Discover an issue**: uses [Bias For Action]() to alert stakeholders quickly, and most importantly, uses [Earn Trust]() by raising the concern respectfully and privately to **the relevant parties** first. If we publicly escalate a small, unproven issue without attempting to solve it privately first, we **violate** [Earn Trust]()
- **Disagreement**: challenge ([Have Backbone]()), respectfully push back with **data or facts** ([Deep Dive]()). Based on the issue's context, it's better to do it **privately** with only **relevant parties**. Or otherwise the public disagrement might lead to uncomfort or embarassement, and it will violate [Earn Trust]()
- **Quick Action**: uses [Bias for Action](). Normally, it will violate [Dive Deep]() & [Frugality](). While it delivers immediate result, it fails to **thoroughly investigate** the final impact, making a **costly decision** without proper justification.
- [Frugality](): does not mean avoiding all costs; it means maximizing value.
- **Delay Launch**: sometimes means lost market opportunity. It violates [Bias For Action]() as **speed matters in business**
- **never ship a fundamentally broken** to customer. It causes bad user experience (violate [Customer Obsession](), [Earn Trust]())
- fix the process **incrementally** while still delivering value.
