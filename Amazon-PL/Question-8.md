## 👥 Scenario: The Undefined Process (Testing Learn/Curious vs. Ownership)

You are moved to a new team that has no formal documentation for its core deployment process. Every deployment requires senior engineers to manually intervene, leading to frequent errors. The senior engineers simply explain that "it's always been done this way."

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Accept the process, focusing solely on your assigned tickets and relying on the senior engineers for deployment assistance.
* **B.** Schedule a meeting with the senior engineers to document the process and then use your own time to create a simple automation script for deployment.
* **C.** Immediately spend a full week building a completely new, automated CI/CD pipeline, refusing all feature work until it's done.
* **D.** Send an email to the entire organization asking if other teams have better deployment tools you can "borrow" to fix your team's process.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **B** | **Invent and Simplify; Ownership; Learn and Be Curious** | This shows strong **Ownership** by tackling the problem. It uses **Learn and Be Curious** to understand the manual process first and then uses **Invent and Simplify** to build a practical, low-cost fix (**Frugality**). This is the definition of taking initiative. |
| **2** | **C** | **Invent and Simplify; Insist on the Highest Standards** | While aiming for the highest standard, it violates **Bias for Action** and **Deliver Results** by blocking all feature work. You should fix the process incrementally while still delivering value. |
| **3** | **D** | **Frugality; Earn Trust** | While looking for existing tools is **Frugal**, immediately publicizing your team's internal chaos violates **Earn Trust** and is poor political maneuvering. You should attempt to solve it internally first. |
| **4** | **A** | **Ownership; Learn and Be Curious** | This completely violates **Ownership** and **Invent and Simplify**. It accepts the status quo and relies on others, which is the opposite of a leader's mindset. |
