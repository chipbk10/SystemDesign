### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit – Super Simple

**Short meaning:**  
Speak up when you think something is wrong – even to your boss.  
But once the decision is made, you fully support it 100%.

**Simple words:**  
- Disagree loudly and honestly if you think it’s a bad idea.  
- Explain why, with facts.  
- But if the boss still says “go,” you stop arguing and work hard to make it succeed.

**Easy example:**  
Team wants to launch a feature fast.  
You say: “Wait, it will break for customers – here’s the data.”  
Boss listens but decides to launch anyway.  
You reply: “Okay, I disagree… but I commit. Let’s make it work.”  
Then you help like it was your own idea.

That’s Have Backbone.  
Be brave to challenge. Be strong to follow through.
