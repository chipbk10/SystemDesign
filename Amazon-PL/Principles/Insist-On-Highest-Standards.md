### Insist on the Highest Standards – Super Simple

**Short meaning:**  
Never accept “good enough.” Always push for amazing.

**Simple words:**  
- You demand super high quality.  
- You notice tiny defects and fix them.  
- You keep raising the bar, even when others say “it’s already fine.”

**Easy example:**  
The website loads in 2 seconds.  
Most people: “Fast enough!”  
“Insist on Highest Standards” person:  
“No, customers hate waiting. We must make it 0.8 seconds.”

They keep pushing until it’s perfect (or as close as possible).  
That’s Insist on the Highest Standards.
