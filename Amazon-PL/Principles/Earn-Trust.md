**Earn Trust** = Be honest, nice, and admit mistakes.

**Simple words:**  
Listen well. Speak clearly. Be respectful. Say “I was wrong” when you mess up. Don’t act like you’re perfect.

**Easy example:**  
Your team launches a feature and it breaks.  
Instead of hiding it or blaming others, you quickly say:  
“Sorry, that was my mistake. Here’s what went wrong and how I’ll fix it.”  

People trust you more when you do that.  

That’s Earn Trust.
