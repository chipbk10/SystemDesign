### Frugality – Super Simple

**Short meaning:**  
Do more with less. Money saved = money to grow faster.

**Simple words:**  
- No fancy stuff if cheap works.  
- Be smart, not wasteful.  
- Small teams, simple tools, reuse things.

**Easy example:**  
Team wants a big expensive off-site meeting in a hotel.  
Most people: “Yes, let’s book it!”  
Frugality person:  
“No. We meet in the office, order pizza, and save $20,000. Same ideas, zero waste.”

They get great results without spending extra.  
That’s Frugality.
