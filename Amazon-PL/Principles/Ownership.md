### Ownership in Amazon LPs – Super Simple

**Ownership** = Act like you own the company.  
Don’t say “that’s not my job.”

**Simple words:**  
Leaders think long-term.  
They never say “that’s not my job.”  
They take responsibility even when it’s someone else’s mistake.  
They fix things for the whole company, not just their team.

**Easy example:**  
A package is late.  
Most people think: “That’s the delivery team’s problem.”  
An “Ownership” person thinks: “This hurts the customer. I will jump in, find the problem, and help fix it—even if it’s not my department.”

They act like the whole company is theirs.  
That’s Ownership.
