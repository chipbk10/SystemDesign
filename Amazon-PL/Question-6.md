## 💰 Scenario: The Costly Optimization (Testing Frugality vs. Deliver Results)

Your team has the option to integrate a new third-party cloud service that automatically optimizes your data storage. Implementing this service will **save 15 hours of engineering effort per week** (freeing up time for new features) but will **cost the business an extra $5,000 per month** in service fees.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Immediately implement the third-party service, justifying the cost by the 15 hours of regained engineering time, which aligns with **Bias for Action**.
* **B.** Search for a lower-cost or free open-source solution that would require a full week of initial setup time but would avoid the recurring $5,000 fee.
* **C.** Calculate the long-term monetary value of the 15 hours of recovered engineering time and present a clear ROI case to your manager to justify the $5,000 expense.
* **D.** Reject the paid service entirely, stating that the $5,000 cost violates the principle of **Frugality** and continue with the manual process.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **C** | **Frugality; Dive Deep; Are Right, A Lot** | The most balanced choice. **Frugality** does not mean avoiding all costs; it means maximizing value. You use **Dive Deep** skills to calculate the precise ROI, ensuring the decision to spend money is data-driven and justified, aligning with **Are Right, A Lot**. |
| **2** | **B** | **Frugality; Invent and Simplify** | A strong second choice. It demonstrates creativity and commitment to **Frugality** by looking for an alternative and shows a willingness to invest upfront time to avoid recurring costs. However, it delays the immediate benefit. |
| **3** | **A** | **Bias for Action; Deliver Results** | Violates **Frugality** and **Dive Deep**. While it delivers immediate results (freeing up time), it fails to thoroughly investigate the financial impact, making a costly decision without proper justification. |
| **4** | **D** | **Frugality** (misapplied) | Violates **Think Big** and **Invent and Simplify**. This is a small, reactive way to apply Frugality that sacrifices future efficiency and does not look for creative solutions to a recurring problem. |
