## 🔍 Scenario: The Unstable System (Testing Standards vs. Frugality)

You are tasked with fixing a bug in an old, critical service. You discover the entire service is unstable, complex, and poorly documented. A proper, high-standard rewrite will take three sprints (six weeks) but will reduce future bugs by 80%. A minimal fix applied to the old code will take half a sprint (one week) and solve the immediate problem, but the service will remain fragile.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Implement the minimal fix quickly, as the rewrite is too expensive and violates **Frugality**.
* **B.** Inform your manager of the necessary rewrite and insist on allocating the next three sprints to fix the system properly, citing future savings.
* **C.** Implement the minimal fix now, and commit to finding one day every sprint to chip away at the necessary rewrite.
* **D.** Ask another team to take over the responsibility for maintaining the old service so your team can focus on new features.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **B** | **Insist on the Highest Standards; Think Big** | The ideal Amazonian answer. Leaders raise the bar and fix the root cause. This demonstrates the courage to challenge the status quo (**Have Backbone**) and think long-term about stability. |
| **2** | **C** | **Bias for Action; Ownership** | A practical compromise. It prioritizes the immediate fix (**Bias for Action**) while still showing **Ownership** and dedicating resources to the high standard, but it's not as assertive as Option B. |
| **3** | **A** | **Frugality; Deliver Results** | Addresses the immediate issue quickly, but allows a fragile system to persist. This is a short-term, small-thinking approach that violates **Insist on the Highest Standards** and **Ownership**. |
| **4** | **D** | **Ownership** | Violates **Ownership**. Leaders never say "that's not my job." Passing off a problem without solving it is highly discouraged. |
