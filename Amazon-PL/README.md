## Amazon Leadership Principles (16)

### Core Principles (6)

1.  **Customer Obsession:** Start with the customer and work backwards. Relentlessly focus on earning and keeping customer trust.
2.  **Ownership:** Leaders are long-term thinkers. They act on behalf of the entire company, not just their own team, and never say "that's not my job."
3.  **Are Right, A Lot:** Leaders seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their own beliefs. They have strong judgment and good instincts.
4.  **Dive Deep:** Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them.
5.  **Bias for Action:** Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and don't require extensive study. Value calculated risk-taking.
6.  **Deliver Results:** Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and timely fashion. They rise to the occasion and never settle.
