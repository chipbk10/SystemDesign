### **Example: Feature Request Prioritization**

**Scenario:** It is the start of a new sprint. Your team has five days of capacity. You have three tasks on the backlog:

1.  **High-Priority Feature:** A requested new feature that marketing believes will drive a 10% increase in new customer sign-ups. (Est. time: 4 days)
2.  **Tech Debt:** Refactoring a 5-year-old service that is becoming unstable and slows down development, but doesn't cause customer-facing issues yet. (Est. time: 3 days)
3.  **Customer Feedback:** Fix a minor UI/UX bug that several paying, long-term customers have complained about, but doesn't stop them from using the service. (Est. time: 1 day)

**Question:** Which two tasks should your team prioritize this week?

* **A.** High-Priority Feature and Tech Debt.
* **B.** High-Priority Feature and Customer Feedback.
* **C.** Tech Debt and Customer Feedback.
* **D.** Only the High-Priority Feature.

| Choice | Principle Mapping | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **B** | **Customer Obsession**; **Deliver Results** | The **High-Priority Feature** demonstrates **Think Big** and **Deliver Results** (10% sign-up increase). The **Customer Feedback** task directly addresses the needs of *existing* customers, which is the definition of **Customer Obsession**. In Amazon's view, new business *and* satisfying existing customers are usually the top priority. |
| **A** | **Invent and Simplify**; **Think Big** | **Tech Debt** aligns with **Invent and Simplify** (improving processes) and **Think Big** (investing in the future platform). This is a solid second-best choice, showing long-term vision, but often comes after direct customer value. |
| **C** | **Dive Deep**; **Frugality** | This focuses on internal stability and small fixes but neglects the big **Deliver Results** goal of new customer acquisition, which is often a strategic priority. |

---

### **Key Takeaway**

Always choose the option that best reflects a balance of **Customer Obsession**, **Insist on the Highest Standards** (quality, long-term thinking), and **Bias for Action** (getting things done). *Avoid* options that:

* Pass the buck or avoid responsibility (**Ownership**).
* Prioritize speed over quality/customer experience.
* Fail to investigate the root cause (**Dive Deep**).
