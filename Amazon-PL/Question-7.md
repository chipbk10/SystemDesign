## 2. 💡 Scenario: The Incremental Launch (Testing Big vs. Standards)

You have an idea for a massive feature that will fundamentally change the customer experience and align with the "Think Big" vision. To get it to market quickly, you've planned a Phase 1 launch with a slightly clunky UI and a slow backend (it takes 5 seconds to load). Phase 2 will involve the clean UI and performance optimization.

**Question:** Rank the following actions from most effective to least effective:

* **A.** Launch Phase 1 immediately to get data and customer feedback, as **Bias for Action** is paramount.
* **B.** Delay the launch until you can ship the clean UI and fast backend because the current 5-second latency violates **Insist on the Highest Standards**.
* **C.** Launch Phase 1, but include a large pop-up disclaimer explaining that the performance is temporary and will be fixed soon.
* **D.** Launch Phase 1, but only roll it out to internal users first to test the initial product's viability before exposing customers to the poor experience.

| Rank | Choice | Primary LP Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **D** | **Insist on the Highest Standards; Customer Obsession** | This is the most balanced. It upholds **Customer Obsession** by shielding paying customers from a poor experience (5-second latency is too slow) while still enabling **Bias for Action** by letting the team test the core functionality. |
| **2** | **B** | **Insist on the Highest Standards** | While strong on quality, it violates **Bias for Action** and **Frugality** by delaying customer validation. Sometimes, a delayed launch means lost market opportunity. |
| **3** | **A** | **Bias for Action** | Violates **Customer Obsession** and **Insist on the Highest Standards**. Five-second latency is severe enough to destroy customer trust and make the initial feature launch fail. You should never ship a fundamentally broken customer experience. |
| **4** | **C** | **Customer Obsession** | Violates **Earn Trust**. Disclaimers do not fix poor engineering. This shifts the blame to the customer and doesn't solve the underlying problem—a poor launch experience. |
