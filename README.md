# System Design

1. How does https work? [https](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/https.md), [handshake](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/handshake.md)
2. Where is a shared session key stored? [https](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/https.md)
3. How to avoid handshake overhead for subsequent https requests? [keep-alive](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/keep-alive.md)
4. How to resume previous https session without doing a full handshake? [partial handshake](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/partial-handshake.md)
5. How to route the subsequent https request to the same server? [sticky session](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/sticky-session.md)
6. How does login work? [session_token](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/authenticate.md), [access_token](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/authenticate.md), [jwt](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/jwt.md), [authenticate](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/authenticate.md), [password](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/password.md)

## Handle Failures

1. How would you design your API to handle unreliable downstream services and ensure it remains responsive and reliable for users? [circuit breaker](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/circuit-breaker.md), [resilience]()
2. Youâ€™re tasked with designing a microservices-based web application with multiple services that need to communicate with each other. These services are deployed on Kubernetes, and you need to ensure reliable communication, handle failures gracefully, enforce rate limits between services, and monitor traffic without adding significant complexity to the application code. How would you approach this problem, and what tools or strategies would you use to achieve these goals? [service mesh](), [circuit breaker](), [rate limiting](), [resilience]()



## Security

1. How to ensure that a message received over https is not altered and comes from a trusted source? [signature](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/Cryptographic/signature.md), [certificate](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/Cryptographic/certificate.md)
2. How does ssl-pinning enhance mobile app security? [ssl-pinning](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/Cryptographic/ssl-pinning.md)
3. Why isn't ssl-pinning used in web app? [ssl-pinning](https://github.com/chipbk10/SystemDesign/blob/master/Cryptographic/ssl-pinning.md)
