- **operating system** includes:
  - **kernel**: the core, handling hardware interactions
  - **user space**: tool, libraries, and apps that users interact with (e.g., bash, GUI, system utilities like `ls`, `dir`, etc.)
  - **services**: background processes (e.g., networking, file systems)
  - **filesystem**: structure for storing files (e.g., `/bin`, `C:\windows`)
- **kernel** manages low-level tasks, acting as a bridge between hardware and software. It includes:
  - **process management**: runs and schedules programs
  - **memory management**: allocates RAM for apps
  - **device drivers**: handles hardware (e.g., CPU, disks, network)
  - **system calls**: provides interface for apps to access resources (e.g., reading files, sending network packages)
