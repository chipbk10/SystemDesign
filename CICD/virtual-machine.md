I. **Virtual Machine**
- emulates entire operating systems, making them ideal for scenarios requiring full isolation.

II. **Use Cases**
- a developer tests an application on windows, ubuntu, and centos simultaneously on a single physical server
- VM can replicate outdated OS environment. It's useful when we want to test our app in an outdated OS
- a cybersecurity team runs malware analysis in a VM to prevent system infection. Full OS isolation ensures malicious code doesn't escape the VM
