I.**Container**
- is a lightweight, isolated environment that packages an application (code) with its dependencies (libraries, framework, runtime) and **run on a host's [kernel]()**

II.**Container vs Virtual Machine**
- Unlike virtual machines (VMs), which include a full [OS]() ([kernel]() + [user space]()), Docker containers are lightweight because they use the hostâ€™s kernel and only package the user space needed for the app.
